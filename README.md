# 3D Maze Screensaver - Technical Demo

This project is a 3D maze screensaver built as a technical demo to test the capabilities of **Google Antigravity**.

## About the Project

This application is a modern reinterpretation of the classic Windows 95 3D Maze screensaver. It features:
*   Procedurally generated mazes.
*   Autonomous bot navigation with "Right-Hand Rule" logic.
*   Dynamic camera movements and inversions.
*   Interactive elements like stones that trigger gravity flips.
*   A "rat" entity that wanders the maze.
*   Easter eggs (try adding `?agy` to the URL!).
*   Audio toggle with visual feedback.

## Built with Google Antigravity

This entire project was constructed almost exclusively using **Google Antigravity**, an advanced AI agentic coding assistant.

The primary goal of this project was to evaluate Antigravity's performance as a "vibe coding" framework—the first of its kind tested by the author. It serves as a testament to how AI can assist in rapidly prototyping and refining complex interactive 3D applications with minimal manual intervention.
